### GOAL
The goal of the project is to build a platform for people to offer their computing power / storage as a service, meaning developers don't need to spend money on a centralized hosting/computing service instead the community whose support developer's app will host it for them and earn some money while doing it. \(I haven't decide which cryptocurrency to use yet ðŸ¤”\)
